Ambience Coloreon
=================

(Or Coloreonic Ambience, if you prefer.)

Ambience-Coloreon is a dumbed-down version of the _lovely_ script by **David Call√©**, [Chameleonic-Ambience](https://plus.google.com/u/0/117867558830601601230/posts/LGHt9zzAPWp).

All _this_ version wants to achieve is colorize the Ambience GTK theme (and Metacity, shortly) to whatever the _user_ wants, and then apply it only once.

Presently, it's command-line only, just like the original. Use it like:

	./ambience-coloreon.py fab1ed
	
Where `fab1ed` is any hexadecimal encoded color you've tastefully picked out beforehand. 

I intend to provide a simple GUI utlity to make this less work. Let's see... `Quickly`?
